## Upgrading an ender 3 s1

About a year ago, I bought an Ender 3 S1. Although I have had a lot of issues with this printer I added a lot of things So let's get into them. 

### PEI Flex Plate

The First update I did was to add a PEI build plate, the S1 came stock with a Cmagnet Plate  build plate. which within a month I  had destroyed due to setting the nozzle to low and dragging the nozzle  on the build plate and melting it. so  I bought a cheap dual sided PEI plate. Affiliate link below. That build plate works well but  I need to wash it more often than my other PEI plate.

### Recovery From The Blob Of Doom

The next couple updates where more repaired do to a blob of doom  I had to replace the entire  hotend and heatsink assembly, twice. after that I stopped letting it print unattended.

  

### Octoprint

For a while I used a octoprint on a pi 3a+ that worked well despite the age of the Pi (Got during the Great Pi Shortage) I installed a few extensions such as pretty gcode, octolaps, octoeverywhere  and cancel object. there might have been others but recently  I switched to… 

### Klipper

I’ll be honest, I thought that this would be much harder than it was. I have a reasonable   experience with Linux pis and cmd interfaces in general , maybe my issues are farther down the road but I have not had any issues with it. Currently I have a it connected to octoeverywhere, klipper screen and case printed for it. 

### CHT Nozzle

I got a knock off cht mk8 nozzle of AliExpress I have not used it much but I hope to use it soon.

maybe improve the flow rate 

## Future Upgrades,

### Taurus v5

I wanted to add better cooling so  I bought the parts for this and printed it just waiting for a few things to arrive. Apparently the sprite extruder has bad cooling So this printed upgrade is supposed to  improve that with the aid of two 5015 blower fans.

### Input Shaping

I also bought an adxl345 to get faster without ringing artifacts  we will see how that goes
