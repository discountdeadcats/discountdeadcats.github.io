# Thoughts on Smart Watches

I recently found my old **Fitbit Versa 2**. It has been a change of pace from my old **Casio F91W**. Even though I have to charge it, and even though I can’t use it with my phone in school, I still enjoy it. But I started thinking about getting a more open-style watch—something maybe a little older.

I bought a **Pebble 301OR (Pebble Classic Orange)**.

With the new Pebble releases earlier this year and the recent drama between Rebble and Eric Migicovsky, I hope I’ll still be able to use the watch when it arrives and after I replace its battery.

## But first: Why a Pebble?

For the longest time, I wore Casio watches. No fuss, no mess, no charging. I still have one. But when I misplace mine and have to use a smartwatch, I find it very handy to check the weather and also fun to experiment with app development—even though I’m not very good at it.

So I brought out my old Versa 2. It’s fine if you don’t mind Google tracking you, but I wanted something with more privacy, a more open ecosystem, and a display that’s more useful outdoors. So I bought a Pebble—for the good price of **$30**, plus **$10** for a replacement battery.

I’ll post an update when it arrives along with my first impressions.
