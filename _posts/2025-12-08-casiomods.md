# Casio Watch Modding

Casio watches are awesome. I own many of them I've acquired over the years from prizes in camp to the awards at school. They are a popular prize for children in my community. The one I have today is the Casio F-91W, a very popular watch. Wikipedia has a whole article on it and how it was used in terrorism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W#Usage_in_terrorism), but I love this watch. I've had it for at least a few years, but with the new Pebble watch coming out and its project I think deserves more attention called the Olleewatch, which turns a regular Casio F-91W into a smartwatch, which I will check out sometime soon. 

But that's not what I'm talking about today. No, today I am talking about the modding community. You thought that mods were only for PlayStation, Wiis, phones, computers? Think again. People take these classic Casio watches and make them look even cooler. There's a whole subreddit dedicated to this practice. Adding new straps, swapping out the LED for a brighter one or one of a different color, or even some crazy mods such as ![this](https://preview.redd.it/ae1300-hydromod-success-v0-s6icgkvc6w5g1.jpeg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=14777137e0a3d857693686052a4323e67b9f26f9). 

I decided for my first mod to do something pretty simple. I would add a piece of Kapton tape to the LCD to make it have a nice amber CRT look.
