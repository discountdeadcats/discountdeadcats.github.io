# Building a Meshtastic Pebble App

As per my last blog post, I have been looking into smartwatches, so I thought I would try to make an app for them. I’ve also been interested in the Meshtastic network, so I decided to experiment with building a companion app for either the Pebble or the Fitbit Versa 2. Let’s see how this goes.

### Update numero 1

I can’t get my Fitbit/Google account to act as my dev account. I spent at least an hour trying to figure that out, so I guess it’s on to the Pebble.
