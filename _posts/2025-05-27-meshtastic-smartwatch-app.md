# Building a Meshtastic Pebble App

As per my last blog post, I have been looking into smartwatches, so I thought I would try to make an app for them. I’ve also been interested in the Meshtastic network, so I decided to experiment with building a companion app for either the Pebble or the Fitbit Versa 2. Let’s see how this goes.

### Update numero 1

I can’t get my Fitbit/Google account to act as my dev account. I spent at least an hour trying to figure that out, so I guess it’s on to the Pebble.


### Update 2


I love the effort to make it easy to develop for the pebble watches. contrast this with the FitBit sdk. As comfortable as I am with the terminal, it is still frustrating that there is no good IDE. It might be my phone's filter or my google accounts. When I try to sideload an app to my FitBit versa, it crashes.

Again, contrast this to the Pebble. They have a whole cloud IDE that you can access with just a github account, push/pull and backup. straight to github.

I have been hard at work building the cobble app trying to test my darn pebble-meshtastic app(still looking for a name for that btw) my own phone blocks the pebble dev settings and all the other android devices I have are two old to run the app. but regardless it is much easier than the fitbit.
